# Here are some of my projects I have worked on!

### Mosquito Research

In 2022 I had the opportunity to work in the INSTAR Lab at UH Manoa. There I worked over the summer looking at mosquito cold tolerance in relation to their microbiome. I found that males were less tolerant to cold than females and that the more diverse the mosquitoes microbiome the more tolerant they were to cold.
