### Where i'm From

My name is Mehana Leafchild I was born and raised on the East side of Oahu. I love to hike, surf, paddle, run, and spend time with my family. I have grown up playing in Hawaii's beautiful mountains and beaches. My affinity to these beautiful places have brought me to want to make a career out of protecting them. I want to preserve and protect the ecosystems, resources, and culture of Hawaii for future generations to enjoy.
